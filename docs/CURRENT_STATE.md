## Snapshot

- **Last updated:** 2026-09-02
- **Current phase:** Phase 1, EPIC S2 extended quant research; BTC-189 is the
  last EPIC S2 ticket before the rest of EPIC T
- **Authoritative execution roadmap:** [Structured Tickets v2.6](execution/bitcoin_swing_predictor_structured_tickets_v2_6.md)
- **Current implementation frontier:** BTC-189, statistical predictor
  diagnostics
- **Last completed ticket:** BTC-187, Monte Carlo portfolio risk analysis
- **Current IN_PROGRESS ticket:** BTC-019
- **Current BLOCKED tickets:** None recorded in Structured Tickets v2.6
- **Next dependency-satisfied ticket:** BTC-189, first by V2 execution order
- **Other ready tickets:** BTC-192
- **Latest verified test baseline:** 2684 passed with Python 3.12 on 2026-09-02
- **Last relevant implementation/review commit:** `849c02d2946d65276cd18966eb68f39d266194bc`
  (`fix: bound BTC-187 resampling indices`)

## Price-Reference State

```text
BTC-019 = IN_PROGRESS
Bitstamp sole canonical candidate = REJECTED
BTC_REFERENCE_COMPOSITE_V1 = RESEARCH_INCONCLUSIVE
BTC-019B = MIXED
BTC_REFERENCE_COMPOSITE_V2 = FROZEN_RESEARCH_PROTOCOL
production canonical reference = UNRESOLVED
```

Normal Phase-1 implementation may continue through injectable, versioned
reference-price boundaries. Final authoritative strategy calibration and
certification remain blocked until the production canonical reference is
resolved. See [PRICE_SOURCE_POLICY_V1](policies/price_source_policy_v1.md).

## Important Unresolved Decisions

- Production canonical BTC reference selection remains unresolved under
  BTC-019.

## Important Active Invariants

- Every decision and research row must remain point-in-time correct.
- Missing numerical inputs are surfaced; they are never silently zero-filled.
- Shared quant, risk, execution, and accounting owners must be reused across
  advisory, paper-trading, and backtesting paths.
- Never average down; stops never widen; aggregate risk-at-stop remains bounded.
- Strategy, configuration, policy, and provenance versions remain persisted for
  deterministic replay.

## Update Policy

When implementation or review materially changes project state, update only
the affected snapshot fields above. Detailed ticket truth stays in Structured
Tickets v2.6; this file must not become a second roadmap or ticket ledger.
